# Front-End Developer Test
Due to the overwhelming amount of applicants, we have created the following coding challenge to assist our hiring process. 

In order to complete this exercise, you will need a computer with NodeJS installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't yet.

Once it is installed, please fork this repo and clone it locally. 

# Goals
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a client side application with React that retrieves and displays the information provided in the MOCK_DATA.json file. 

# Requirement
App users should be able to review all data on a aesthetically pleasing interface. Such interface should provide users the ability to filter results by "section" and sort users by all other data elements. 

As an optional "extra credit", connect the UI to a public GraphQL endpoint from: https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-apis

# Notes
Implementation details are mostly up to you, just note that best practices are expected.

Once you are done, please push your changes to your repo and share it with us.
